# CS 11: Makefile for C track, assignment 2.
#

#
# NOTE: When pasting this file from a browser window into a text editor,
#       the tab characters at the beginning of the command lines will
#       almost always be replaced by e.g. eight spaces.  You MUST convert
#       them back into a single tab or this file will not work!  "make"
#       is _extremely_ picky about this: command lines must start with one
#       tab and no spaces, no more and no less.  You're better off saving
#       this file directly (e.g. by typing control-S in mozilla or firefox).
#       Also, remove this comment in your submitted Makefile.
